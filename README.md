Upstream is an organizational tool with an integrated social-networking platform that assists users
with navigating their gaming interests and connecting users with similar interests. 
The Upstream tool is one that is hosted via a website, and will have the customer create a profile to access the tool. 
By using the data from a user’s library of video games held by the platform they play on, the user will be 
able to do various functions with that data and have it associated with their profile for the tool. 
The platform that Upstream will work with is “Steam,” a popular computer game distribution service. 
The user’s Steam game library data will be available in Upstream to be usable for categorizing games into lists based on
their status of completion, portraying the user’s gaming preferences for their profile.
